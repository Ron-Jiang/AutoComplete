## Overview

* __Purpose__:  To implement a simple automatic word-completion system.
* __*Task 1*__: Implement algorithms for DLB insertion and traversal.
* __*Task 2*__: Implement an algorithm for retrieving one word prediction.

## Background

Autocomplete is a commonly used feature in mobile phones, text editors, and search engines. As a user types in letters, the system shows a list of word predictions to help the user complete the word they are typing. The core of an efficient autocompletion system is a fast algorithm for retrieving word predictions based on the user input. The word predictions are all the words (in a given dictionary) that start with what the user has typed so far (i.e., the list of words for which the user's input is a prefix).

In this assignment we will build a simple autocompletion system using a DLB trie which allows 
the user to add a new word to its dictionary when none of the predictions are selected by the user.

The `AutoCompleteInterface` defines a Java interface for a dictionary that provides word predictions for such an autocompletion system. Besides storing a set of words, the dictionary keeps track of a prefix String, which starts with the empty String. You will implement methods to add one character to and delete the last character of that prefix String. You will also implement methods that use that prefix String for various operations, such as checking if the prefix String is one of the words in the dictionary, retrieving the number of words that have the prefix String as a prefix, and adding the prefix String to the dictionary.

## Details

In the first part of this assignment, you will implement algorithms for:

- inserting a `StringBuilder` object into a DLB trie by filling in the `add(String word)` method below. You may want to add and call a private recursive helper method.

```java
  /**
   * Adds a word to the dictionary in O(alphabet size*word.length()) time
   * @param word the String to be added to the dictionary
   * @return true if add is successful, false if word already exists
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if word is the empty string
   */
    public boolean add(String word){
      //TODO: implement this method
      return false;
    }
```

The `DLBNode` class is already defined for you in `AutoComplete.java`. You will use a doubly-linked list of siblings, a child reference, and an upwards reference to the node's parent.
The `isWord` field of a node is true if and only if the node is at the end of a word in the dictionary.
The `size` field keeps track of the number of nodes with `isWord==true` in the subtree rooted at the node, including the node itself. The `add` method should update the `size` field for some of the nodes that it goes over. You will need to think about for which nodes `size` should be incremented.


```java
//The DLB node class
private class DLBNode {
  private char data;
  private int size;
  private boolean isWord;
  private DLBNode nextSibling;
  private DLBNode previousSibling;
  private DLBNode child;
  private DLBNode parent;

  private DLBNode(char data){
      this.data = data;
      size = 0;
      isWord = false;
      nextSibling = previousSibling = child = parent = null;
  }
}
 ```


The next set of the methods modify the prefix String maintained by the dictionary. These methods are: `advance(char c)` for appending a character to the prefix String, `retreat()` for deleting the last character, and `reset()` for resetting it back to the empty String. More details about these methods can be found below. Your code should maintain a `DLBNode currentNode` reference to always point to the DLB node at the end of the prefix String. `currentNode` is null when the prefix String is `""`, moves over the sibling list of the root node upon the first call to `advance`, moves possibly sideways then down the trie with each further call to `advance`, moves possibly sideways then up the trie with `retreat` until resetting to `null` when the prefix String becomes empty, and resets to `null` with `reset`.

```java
  /**
   * appends the character c to the current prefix in O(alphabet size) time. 
   * This method doesn't modify the dictionary.
   * @param c: the character to append
   * @return true if the current prefix after appending c is a prefix to a word 
   * in the dictionary and false otherwise
   */
    public boolean advance(char c){
      //TODO: implement this method
      return false;
    }

  /**
   * removes the last character from the current prefix in O(1) time. This 
   * method doesn't modify the dictionary.
   * @throws IllegalStateException if the current prefix is the empty string
   */
    public void retreat(){
      //TODO: implement this method
    }

  /**
   * resets the current prefix to the empty string in O(1) time
   */
    public void reset(){
      //TODO: implement this method
    }
```

The last set of methods operate on the prefix String by checking whether it is a word in the dictionary (`isWord()`), adding it if not (`add()`), retrieving the number predictions for the prefix String (`getNumberOfPredictions`), and retrieving one of the predictions (if any) (`retrievePrediction`). Retrieving the number predictions should be as simple as returning the `size` field of the `currentNode`. The `add()` method should increment the `size` field for some of the nodes (which ones?). (Hint: you may need to climb up the trie.)

```java
  /**
   * @return true if the current prefix is a word in the dictionary and false
   * otherwise. The running time is O(1).
   */
    public boolean isWord(){
      //TODO: implement this method
      return false;
    }

  /**
   * adds the current prefix as a word to the dictionary (if not already a word)
   * The running time is O(alphabet size*length of the current prefix). 
   */
    public void add(){
      //TODO: implement this method
    }

  /** 
   * @return the number of words in the dictionary that start with the current 
   * prefix (including the current prefix if it is a word). The running time is 
   * O(1).
   */
    public int getNumberOfPredictions(){
      //TODO: implement this method
      return 0;
    }
  
  /**
   * retrieves one word prediction for the current prefix. The running time is 
   * O(prediction.length())
   * @return a String or null if no predictions exist for the current prefix
   */
    public String retrievePrediction(){
      //TODO: implement this method
      return null;
    }
```

## Testing and Debugging

To test your code, use `A2Test.java` and develop your own test cases. This program needs a dictionary file. I have included `dict8.txt`, which is the same dictionary that we used in Assignment 1. I highly recommend that you start by creating your own small dictionary (e.g., similar to `small.txt`) to test your code. Sample output is provided below. The file `small.txt` contains the following words:

```
abc
a
aba
xyz
x
efg
ef
```

```
java A2Test small.txt

Debugging is a skill that improves with practice.

```java
printTree("fun");
```
The output would look like the following. The numbers between parentheses are the sizes and the asterisks mark nodes that have `isWord == true`.

```
